# Chrome Extension Template

A template for developing a Chrome extension using Vite, React, and TypeScript.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies and run the development server:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will generate the `dist` directory.

2. Load the extension in Chrome:

- Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
- Enable the "Developer mode" toggle.
- Click the "Load unpacked" and select the `dist` directory.

You're all set!
Look for "Chrome Extension" in your toolbar's Extensions menu and click it.
You should see a popup with a "Popup" message.

Hot reloading is enabled, so you can edit the source code and see the changes immediately.
